Well Josh. Here you are, You've done a pretty crummy Job keeping up with unity practice this year.
It likely won't make much difference to the people reviewing your portfolio, if the see you did one or two commits last minute.
This isn't for them. This is for you.
This is a commitment to make commits.
You are a Junkie. Those little green squares, they're your drug of choice this Summer, With the Covid 19 Pandemic, you're not taking classes, so you've gotta whip your own rear in gear and make something happen.

I've downloaded a unity tutorial for a FPS Microgame.
Im most interested in learning about camera controllers in 3D space.
